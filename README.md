## What is PhyloGenesis?

**PhyloGenesis** is a creative procedural generation game where you can craft your own trees and plantsâ€”each one entirely **unique**, **organic**, and **unpredictable**.

Built using **Unity** and **C#**, this sandbox experience is powered by nature-inspired procedural algorithms, enabling the growth of plants that feel alive and endlessly diverse.

Whether you're a nature lover, developer, or just love watching things grow, **PhyloGenesis** lets you:

- Generate infinite tree species with unique traits  
- Tweak growth parameters like branch density, curvature, and leaf clusters  
- Build entire biomes of procedurally generated flora  
- Export or capture your creations as images or 3D models (planned)
